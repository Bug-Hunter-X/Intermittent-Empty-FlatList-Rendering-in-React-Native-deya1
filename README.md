# Intermittent Empty FlatList Rendering in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native intermittently renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API. The issue is sporadic and challenging to reproduce consistently.

## Bug Description

A FlatList component is used to display data fetched from a remote API.  While the API call is successful and the data is received, the FlatList occasionally remains empty. No console errors are present, making debugging difficult.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on an iOS/Android emulator or physical device.
4. Observe the FlatList.  The issue manifests inconsistently but can sometimes be seen immediately upon app launch or after multiple refreshes of the data.

## Solution

The solution addresses a potential race condition or data update timing problem by adding a conditional check that ensures the data array is not empty before rendering the FlatList.
